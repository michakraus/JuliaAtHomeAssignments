## 3. Equations

Implement the possibility to change the equation, i.e. write an `Equation` type that stores the functions providing the vector fields and initial conditions.

Implement a simulation for `n` independent charged particles in some prescribed electromagnetic field:
$$
\dot{x} = v , \quad
\dot{v} = E (x) + v \times B(x) .
$$
